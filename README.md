Snow Water Equivalent Reconstruction Model
=================

This project is intended to facilitate access and improvements to the snow water equivalent reconstruction model as originally developed by Bin Guan (Jet  Propulsion Lab, NASA) and Noah P. Molotch (Jet Propulsion Lab, NASA; Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado, Boulder) and Steve Jepsen (USGS/JPL).

1. calc_nldas.pro was updated to correct wind speed for forest density on 2013.06.18. Use those other input files to to run 2012.12.14 version
2. forden.dat was updated from 2006 nlcd forest canopy density. originally it was meant to interpolate between 2001, 2006 and 2011 nlcd forest canopy density in 2014.05.08 but 2011 looks odd. using UMD forest cover change product instead.
